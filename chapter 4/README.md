## Files and Descriptions

## 1. Avoiding_Deadlock.py

This script demonstrates how to avoid deadlock situations in MPI communication by carefully organizing message passing between processes. 

**Explanation:**
- The script first checks the rank of the process (`rank`).
- Process 0 sends data to process 4, and process 1 sends a string message to process 8.
- Process 4 receives the data from process 0, and process 8 receives the string from process 1.
- This example ensures there is no circular waiting or deadlock between the processes by coordinating sends and receives appropriately.

**OUTPUT:**

## 2. Collective_communication_using_broadcast.py

This code illustrates collective communication using the `broadcast` method from `mpi4py` to share data among processes.

**Explanation:**
- Process 0 initializes a variable (`variable_to_share`) to share with all other processes.
- The `bcast` function is used to broadcast this variable from process 0 to all other processes.
- Similarly, an array is scattered among the processes using the `scatter` function. Each process receives part of the array and prints the received value.
- The `Barrier()` ensures that all processes synchronize before printing, ensuring ordered output.

## 3. Collective_communication_using_gather_function.py

This script demonstrates the use of the `gather` function for gathering data from all processes into the root process.

**Explanation:**
- Each process computes a value (`data`) based on its rank.
- The `gather` function collects this data from all processes and sends it to the root process (rank 0).
- The root process then prints the received data from all processes, showing how data from different processes can be collected and aggregated.

## 4. Collective_communication_using_Scatter_function.py

This code demonstrates the `scatter` function, a collective communication operation, to distribute data from the root process to all other processes.

**Explanation:**
- Process 0 initializes an array (`array_to_share`) and uses `scatter` to send portions of the array to all processes.
- Each process receives a different part of the array and prints the received value.
- The use of `Barrier()` synchronizes the processes before printing the results.

## 5. Point_to_point Implementation.py

This is another example of point-to-point communication where processes send and receive messages directly between each other.

**Explanation:**
- Process 0 sends data (a number) to process 4, and process 1 sends a string to process 8.
- Process 4 receives the data from process 0, and process 8 receives the string from process 1.
- This example demonstrates basic point-to-point communication with message passing between specific pairs of processes.
