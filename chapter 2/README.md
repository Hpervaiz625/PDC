# Chapter 2:
### Topics Covered

## Files and Descriptions

### **1. `barrier.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**
    - The barrier.py script demonstrates the use of a Barrier to synchronize multiple threads. Three runners (Huey, Dewey, Louie) start in parallel and must all reach the barrier before continuing, simulating a synchronized race.

----

### **2. `condition.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**

    - In condition.py, a Condition object is used to synchronize a producer-consumer scenario. The producer adds items to a list, and the consumer removes them. If the list is empty, the consumer waits for the producer to add items.


----- 
### **3. `event.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**

    - The event.py script demonstrates an Event to control the flow between a producer and consumer. The producer generates random items, while the consumer processes them once the event is set.

----------

### **4. `my_thread_lock2.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**

    - In my_thread_lock2.py and my_threadclass_lock.py, the use of a Lock ensures that only one thread at a time can access shared resources, ensuring thread-safe execution in a multi-threaded environment.

---------

### **5. `Rlock.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**

    - In Rlock.py, a RLock (Reentrant Lock) is used to allow the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times. It demonstrates an adder and remover pattern for managing shared resources with reentrant locking.
 ---------------------------
## **6. `semapore.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**


    - The semapore.py script uses a Semaphore to limit access to a shared resource. The producer generates an item and releases the semaphore, while the consumer waits to acquire it before processing the item.

--------------------------------
## **7. `thread_definition.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**

    - Scripts like thread_definition.py, thread_determine.py, and thread_name_and_processes.py create and manage basic threads, demonstrating thread creation, naming, and execution flow. Each thread runs a function and synchronizes with join() to ensure all threads complete before the program ends.

-------------------------------
## **7. `thread_with_queue.py`**

- **EXPLAINATION:**

    - The thread_with_queue.py script uses a Queue to safely pass data between producer and consumer threads. The producer adds items to the queue, and the consumers retrieve and process them.
